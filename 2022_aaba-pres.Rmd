## About

We have developed an oral biofilm model to grow dental calculus.

--

The model is used to explore how dietary microremains/molecules become
trapped in dental calculus,

--

and the biases associated with their extraction and interpretation.

???

Whether these biases occur during life, after burial, or during analysis.

---

## Biofilm

Biofilm: Communities of microbial cells within a matrix of extracellular polymers.

Dental plaque is an example of an oral biofilm.

Then ask your friends to spit in a tube

Add the donated saliva to the deepwell plate

And inoculate the substrata for 4 hours at 36&deg;C

In other words,

 is it a viable proxy for dental calculus?

  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            weight = signif(mean(weight_mg), 3),
            sd = signif(sd(weight_mg), 3))

## FTIR analysis

sampled on days 7, 12, 16, 20, 24

following *Asscher et al. 2011*.

#knitr::kable(summary_tbl_out, col.names = col_names, caption = "Summary of samples taken for FTIR analysis.", align = "c")
```
]

## Preparing for FTIR

Samples ground together with KBr.

Repeated grinding for different lengths of time.

Analysed with a Thermo Nicolet is5 spectrometer in transmission,

- 4 cm-1 resolution
- average of 32 scans between wavenumbers 4000 and 400 cm-1

## Discussion

Seemingly no differences in crystallinity (IRSF) between day 16 and 24

- The 'mineralisation' solution doesn't seem to have much effect

--

The composition of the model dental calculus is similar to a modern dental calculus sample.

--

At least in its mineral content, it forms a reasonable proxy for dental calculus.

--

The method seems suitable to complement *in vivo* studies

--

Our goal is NOT to replace *in vivo* studies.
--
 There are very different questions that can be addressed
 
---

## Limitations

The model doesn't account for individual variability of

--

- bacterial composition
- alpha-amylase activity

--

...but these limitations can also be a strength.

--

Calculus deposits are thin and likely don't contain many layers (short maturation period)

--

The bacteria donors are modern humans with a modern microbiome,
so modifications are likely needed to explore palaeodiets

--

Microbiome characterisation

## Applications

.pull-left[
Test extraction methods

- HCl
- EDTA

Explore starch incorporation

- effect of amylase
- effect of certain bacteria

--

.pull-right[

- DNA
- Proteins
- Microscopy

- Unlimited material available (in theory...)
]
---

## Conclusion

The model dental calculus is similar in composition to modern dental calculus.

--

There are limitations to an *in vitro* model,

--

but it can complement *in vivo* studies by providing a more
controlled setting to explore diet and dental calculus.
